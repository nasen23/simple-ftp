#+TITLE: Simple Implementation of FTP Server and Client

The simple implementation of the rfc file transfer protocol, this is just for homework.

** Requirements

- Server should be running on linux system.
- Client require python3 and PyQt5 to work.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r client/requirements.txt
#+END_SRC
Should work just fine.

** Usage

*** Server
First compile the source code. You can do this simply by running make. A binary
file will be created at ~./server/server~.

Run the server with following command.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
server/server [-port N] [-root DIR]
#+END_SRC
Server would be running on port N with working directory at DIR.

*** Client
Move into client directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 main.py
#+END_SRC

** Available Server Commands
- user
- pass
- port
- pasv
- retr
- stor
- quit
- syst
- type
- mkd
- cwd
- cdup
- pwd
- list (partial support, does not accept any argument)
- rmd
- dele
- rnfr
- rnto
- abor (cannot interrupt data transfer, this is actually same as *quit*)
- rest

*Note* that server could only perform data transfer in binary mode.

** Client
The client works out of the box. You don't need to know about ftp commands
to use it.

*Note* that it does not support user custom commands.
